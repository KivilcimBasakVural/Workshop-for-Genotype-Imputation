This directory contains scripts to run GLIMPSE2 on ancient low coverage human genomes that are mapped to human reference genome version hg19.

For any further questions please contact Kivilcim Basak Vural, kivilcimbasak@gmail.com.

Scripts are created to work in UPPMAX, for other servers the paths for the files and the programs should be updated.
